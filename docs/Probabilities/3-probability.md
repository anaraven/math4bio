Will you finish your university courses? Will you get a diploma? Shall you buy health insurance?

Is it true that smoking will kill you? Some people smoked all life and lived long lives. And everybody dies anyway. So what do we mean when we say that "tobacco kills"?

More optimistically, does vitamin C helps you to avoid the flu? Will there be another pandemic in the next ten years? Are all COVID-19 tests equally good, or are some better than others? And, if the test is 99% correct and you tested positive, what does that mean?

How do we know if a supplement increases the growth rate of a plant? How do we know the lethal concentration of a drug? How many replicas should you prepare?

All these questions have two things in common:
they deal with facts that we do not know (yet), and they are all subjects of probabilities. We need to _understand_ probabilities to understand these facts.

Probability is the mathematical tool that allows us to understand and reason about unknown facts. It has been developed only in the last 300 years, and it is essential for any scientist, engineer, medic, lawyer, politician, professional, and for all citizens that want to be informed and have a well-supported opinion.
