# Probability assigns a value to our beliefs
We want to assign a value, a measure of how much we believe that a proposition is true. This value cannot be arbitrary. On the contrary, it must follow clear rules so we can use it to make rational decisions.

First, we want the value to be a real number, so we will be able to compare them. We want to be able to say that one proposition is _more probable_ than another. We can compare real numbers, but not complex numbers.

It is essential to understand the following concept.
Probability is not a property of the proposition, or of the thing we are observing. Indeed, it depends on _what we know_. If we know little, we will assign a value to the probability of a proposition. If we later learn more, we may change the probability.

For example, if I toss a coin, the result is either "heads" or "tails". I can see it but you cannot. You do not know what is the result. Thus, if you thins about the proposition "the coin is heads", you must assign a probability that is somewhere between the probability of "yes, sure" and "no, not at all". Just to fix ideas, let's say that you assign a probability of 50%.

On my side things are different. I know that the coin is "heads", so I have to assign to it the same probability than "yes, sure". My probability will be different from yours, since my knowledge is different from yours. To be more precise, the probability that I assign will be different than the probability that you assign, even if both followed the same rules and assigned the values rationally.
