# Why everybody should learn math

What is the story here?

![](annex/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Tagosaku_to_Mokube_no_Tokyo_Kenbutsu.jpg/422px-Tagosaku_to_Mokube_no_Tokyo_Kenbutsu.jpg)

To understand the story we need to know the language. Without the language we only see the pictures and try to guess the meaning.

Then, to understand the Nature we need to know the language. Galileo said “The laws of Nature are written in the language of mathematics"


> The universe [...] cannot be understood unless one first learns [...] the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, [...] without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.
>
> *Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642),*
> *Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician*


> **Mathematics** is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithms: it's about **understanding**
>
> *William Paul Thurston (1946 – 2012),*
> *American mathematician*

+ the limit of your language are the limits of your world
+ It is *practical* to solve many questions, in everyday life, and in research
+ It is "unreasonably effective" in physics: natural laws have been discovered using *only* mathematics. Later experiments validated these theories. Ex. Newton (Gravity works at scales that Sir Isaac could not foresee), Maxwell (predicted the existence of radio, and that light is an electromagnetic wave), Boltzmann-Gibbs (connected macroscopic thermodynamics with molecule-scale behavior, when not everybody believed that atoms exist), Einstein (General Relativity predicted light bending, and the transformation of matter into energy: atomic power), Gell-Mann (predicted quarks).
+ Math is a high cultural achievement of humanity. It has been invented and developed independently in several places: ancient Babylon, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece (all around Mediterranean and Aegean sea), China, India, Pre-hispanic Mexico, Golden Age Persia, European Renaissance, Industrial England, Soviet Union, etc. We have mathematicians in Turkish money.
    + We need to teach math to receive this cultural legacy
    + Equivalent to all literature since Gilgamesh, all art since cave paintings, all music since we can remember.
+ Math is essentially human. It is something developed in our minds. It does not exist outside our brains (although nature's rules seem to be well described by math)
+ Good mathematics is as beautiful as any piece of art. We need some training to appreciate its beauty, like to appreciate art such as opera, cubist painting, modern ballet, abstract sculpture, and so on.
+ math is a superpower. Allows us to see the invisible and to travel in time backward and forward
+ It is full of perspective changes. Makes you see the same thing with new eyes, and discover new relations.
+ is a tool to meditate, not to calculate
+ math is common sense, carefully extended
+ things come out in a certain way because there is no other way they could possible be
+ When you do not know math, your research is like moving in the city using only the metro: easy, but you can only go to places that others have already prepared. These are crowded places, and it is hard to be noticed here.

    When you know some math, research is like having your own car. Depending on your knowledge level, it can be 
    + a taxi (someone else drives),
    + an sedan car (you drive on paved streets),
    + a jeep (you can go to much more places, you can fix up when things break down), or
    + an experimental autonomous car (you design a new car from the zero)

    You need at least to understand enough mechanics to know when to put gasoline, change oil, maybe change a tire, and to talk to the mechanic so he does not cheat you.

# What is mathematics?
+ Most people say math is "doing things with numbers". In other words, when we say *mathematics*, people thinks of *arithmetics*


## abstraction: 
+ make it general
    + III is the same as OOO, @@@, 😀😀😀, 🐮🐮🐮, 🐑🐑🐑, 🍏🍏🍏, 🍎🍎🍎, 🍊🍊🍊, 🥕🥕🥕. We call it 3. Numbers are abstract, so you can count anything
    + So we can say 🍎🍎🍎=🍊🍊🍊, because 3=3
    + 2+3 = 3+2, 2⨉3 = 3⨉2, but 2^3^≠3^2^
+ second level of abstraction

# Is mathematics hard?
## Math teachers are bad
+ purpose is not clear. It is hard to learn something if we don't know why we are learning it
    + Unfortunately, in many cases we cannot understand the purpose until we learn a little
    + In real life, many mathematical theories have been developed as "games" that mathematicians play, something amusing or beautiful. For some mathematicians, math is an end on itself.
    + Therefore people invented the math *before* having a real-world motivation. Examples:
        + non-Euclidean geometry is essential to Einstein's General Relativity, but was invented 50 years before, as a game;
        + the mathematician P.J.Littlewood said *my work is completely useless, and it will always be*. Today his work is essential to the secure communication on the web. Without his work, modern economy would not exist.

## Rational thinking takes a lot of energy

I can hear you saying *"but math is hard..."*. Is it? Well... it depends. How fast can you calculate the following?

+ 3 x 4
+ 3 x 4 + 5
+ 34 x 45
+ 345 x 456
+ 3456 x 4567

## We have two brains
![](annex/two-brains.png)

Or more precisely two systems of thinking 

> Think-fast-slow
>
> Daniel Kahneman, 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences

System 1: **Fast**

+ instinctive
+ emotional
+ automatic
+ *cheap*

System 2: **Slow**

+ deliberate
+ rational
+ intentional
+ *expensive*


The priority of our organism is

1. Survival
2. Save energy

So *System 1* is the default mode. Most of the time we use the *cheap* intuitive system. *Rational thinking (i.e. math) is not spontaneous*
We need to invest energy to do it

We get tired. We need training.

Doing math is like running 🏃🏻

+ It requires energy and willpower
+ Everybody can run 10K ... if trained correctly

## "They" do not want to share the power
As we said, mathematics is a superpower. Some people already has that power. And they do not want to share it.

## Math *is not* Everywhere

> [Historically] mathematics that makes the most difference to society has been the province of [...] few
> 
>  Societies have valued and cultivated math not because it is everywhere and for everyone but because it is difficult and exclusive
> 
> [...] elite mathematics today [...] remains a discipline that vests special authority in those who [...] are already among our society’s most powerful

[Scientific American, August 2016](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mathematicians-are-overselling-the-idea-that-math-is-everywhere/)

## Math *is not* Everywhere
+ Through history, high impact mathematics has been know only by few people
+ only few people knew the really important mathematics
+ In most societies, mathematics has high social value, because it is difficult and exclusive
+ Today, elite mathematics gives "special authority" to people who is already powerful

## From big pyramids to big data {.fl-r}
![](annex/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Pharaoh.svg){style="width: 145px"}

+ Political power in ancient Egypt was based on the "god" status of the pharaoh
+ He showed his power by *ordering* the Nile to grow
+ It worked because he had a *model* of the seasons

## From big pyramids to big data
+ Today big companies have immense power because they have *models* of people's behavior
+ They even pay you 2% to get your *Big Data*
    + Supermarkets give *fidelity cards* with discounts 
    + Airlines give *free flight* if you register

+ "Knowledge is Power"



+ Mathematics is about
    + Abstraction
    + Logic
    + Coherence (Theorems and their Demonstrations)
    + Geometry
    + Sets
    + Relationships
    + Functions
    + Numbers (Arithmetic)
    + Algebra
    + [3-probability](3-probability.md)

# What is not in this book
+ Geometry
+ Numbers (Arithmetic)
+ differential equations
+ advanced calculus, in 2, 3 or more dimensions, such as used by the electrical engineers
+ graph theory
+ abstract algebra
+ eigenvalues
+ Markov chains


> The only way to ***learn* mathematics** is to ***do* mathematics**
> 
> *Paul Halmos (1916 – 2006)*
> *Hungarian-born American mathematician*

## Software comes and goes|Math is forever
+ We *abstract* the question
+ We *model* the relationships
+ We *solve* the model (using computers)
+ We *interpret* the solution back into biology

Software changes every ~5 years

Models last longer

# Notation
One image is worth a thousand words. Mathematical formulas have to be seen as an image. It requires some training, but at the end is like in the movie "The Matrix": Neo and his friends _look_ at black screens with green letters, but they _see_ what the symbols represent

Notation is universal, more than common language. You can read the same formula in any human language. 

# Precision in the language
"say what we mean"

How much is "two and three"? Some would say 23. Here "and" has not a well defined meaning.

Mathematics keeps us honest. It is much easier to see when we are making assumptions that are not justified.

Adult speakers of Pirahã, an Amazonian language that contains words for just “one,” “two,” “few,” and “many,” have difficulty putting small sets of objects in one-to-one correspondence, and fail in a task working out the consequence of adding to, or subtracting one item from, a small set of objects.

We can probably all agree that
$$🍎🍎🍎+ 🍎🍎= 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎.$$

We see the picture and we read "three apples plus two apples are five apples". Maybe we need to talk and agree on what do $+$ and $=$ represent. We can even agree on the *meaning* of "plus" and "equal". 

 Now we look at a second picture

$$🍋🍋🍋+🍋🍋=🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋$$

and we say "three lemons plus two lemons are five lemons". These are two particular cases. *Can we learn something from the "apples" picture that we can use in the "lemons" picture?*

# I'm wrong. Abstract ≠ Rational
The generous feedback of @annemitchell, a friendly @turtle made me change my mind.

[quote="annemitchell, post:15, topic:8692"]
[quote="andres, post:14, topic:8692"]
because the only real alternative to violence is rational dialog.
[/quote]

Huh. I would have said that the only real alternative to violence is love. So speaking in abstractions, does rational dialog = love?
[/quote]

You are right! Rationality is a tool, and it does not guarantee peace. People who hate other people can be very rational on their aggressive methods.

That is why the French based their republic in liberty, equality and *fraternity*. I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that they learned from the US declaration of independence and improved it. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

What I had in my mind when I wrote that phrase was the idea that "as long as we are committed to a rational conversation, there is no place for violence", as said by [Steven Pinker](https://youtu.be/xBwtpIu5mwc). But we probably need love to start that conversation. Or two parts that hate each other but are not strong enough to defeat the other. Think of the Cold War. Rationality succeeded in 1962, not because of love, but because of a tie in violence.

I'm afraid that violence is the usual consequence of asymmetry of power. Bullies usually win, and are seldom transformed by love. Violence usually stops when there is balance of powers. And then the conversation is usually rational.

One way to unbalance power is to gather a group of like-minded people. That often comes "in the name of love". Love for the team, the country, people like us, our version of deity, the color of our t-shirts. So love can be a double–edged sword.

If you ever watched Star Trek (the original series), you can think that Kirk represented passion and violence; while Spock represented rationality. Nevertheless in the long term Spock was guided by love. The actor who played Spock said that the role changed him to be more rational and compassionate. He actively defended and supported the rest of the cast members, while Kirk become distant. Obviously actors are not characters, but then, maybe the characters are like the actors.

We need love to guide us. Once we decide that we want to do good, we need to think carefully how to do that good. Because good intentions can lead to bad outcomes. There is such thing as *bad love*. Think about overprotected kids, that never learn how to be themselves, eclipsed by "loving" parents.

[quote="annemitchell, post:15, topic:8692"]
I found this piece exciting as in looking at something from a very different perspective than I am used to and finding it compelling. I’m not sure what the other @Turtle folks will offer here, but the structure was certainly good enough to bring me into your logic and get me to think deeply. What specifically are you looking for here? What do you want to accomplish with this piece?
[/quote]

The core idea I want to convey is that *abstraction is good* and should not be avoided. It can be harder to grasp than concrete cases, but it is more powerful.

For example, some powerful abstract ideas are *love*, *justice*, *equality*, *fraternity*, *nation*, *value*, and even *God* in several religions.

On the other side I think that I confused "abstract" and "rational". These are two different things, and I do not know well how they interact. Both are hard, both require effort to grasp, but rationality can be concrete, and abstract can be irrational.

Several comments recommend, like @gregory, other authors that "make the abstract become concrete". It is tempting, but seems like "using an electric scooter instead of walking." 

We cannot always take the easy ride. We need to exercise our mental muscles. We will be trekking in wild land. We cannot pave the forest and expect to be the same.

This perspective comes from "Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business" a book by Neil Postman (1985). The argument —as far as I understand it— is that TV (and similar media) has taught us to see politics (and science, education, and public issues) as entertainment, appealing to our emotions and shutting down our critical thinking. In contrast, Postman argues, people educated to read newspapers were more open to long discourses and elaborated argumentation.

So, for a better world, with better politics, better policies, and better police, we need to understand complex abstract ideas. If we simplify them, we miss their essence.

I will probably miss this long shot. I will be happy if I can convince a few people to learn probabilities.

things you just don't understand.

Maybe we do.

Son, don't think you have a corner on all of virtue vision in a country or that everybody else is fat and selfish, and you're the first generation to come along that's felt dissatisfied.

They all have, you know, about different things. And most of them didn't have the same opportunity and freedoms that you do.

Let's talk poverty. Most places in the world that's not a problem. It's a way of life and rights they're liable to give
you a blank stare because they may not
know what you're talking about. The fact is, more people are living better right here than anywhere else ever before in history.
So don't expect us to roll over and play dead when you say you're dissatisfied.

It's not perfect but it's a great deal better than when we grew up. A hundred men standing in the street hoping for one job selling apples on the street corner. That's one of the things we were dissatisfied about and you don't see that much anymore. You're taller, stronger, healthier, better educated, and you live longer than the last generation, and we don't think that's altogether bad.

You've probably never seen a quarantine sign in your neighbor's door. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough. Probably none of your classmates are crippled with polio. You don't see many mastoid scars anymore.

We've done quite a bit of fighting all around the world. Whether you think it was moral and not, a lot of people are free today to make their own mistakes because of it, and that may just include you.

I don't know.

Maybe part of it is the fact that you're in a hurry. You've grown up on instant orange juice. Flip a dial, instant entertainment. Dial seven digits instant communication. Turning key, push a pedal, instant transportation. Flash a card, instant money shoving a problem. Push a few buttons instant answers. But to some problems you can't get quick answers, no matter how much you want them.

We took a little boy in the central receiving hospital yesterday. was four years old. he weighs eight and a half pounds. his parents just haven't bothered to feed him. now give me a fast answer to that one. One little stop that from ever happening again and if he can't settle that well.

What about the 55,000 Americans who will die on the highways
this year? that's nearly six or seven times the number that'll get killed in Vietnam. Why aren't you up in arms about that or is dying in a car somehow immoral?
Tell me, how to wipe out prejudice I'll settle for just the prejudices you have inside yourselves.

Show me how to get rid of the unlimited capacity for human beings to make themselves believe that they're somehow right and justified in stealing from somebody or hurting somebody, and you just about put this place here out of business.

I don't think the we're telling you to lose your ideals or your sense of outrage. they're the only way things ever get done and there's a lot that still needs doing and we hope you'll tackle it.

You don't have to do anything dramatic like trying to come up with a better country. You can find enough to keep you busy right here. While you're at it, don't break things up in the name of progress or crack a placard stick over somebody's head to help him see the light.

Be careful of his rights because your property and your person and your rights aren't any better than his and next time you may be the one to get it. We remember a man who killed six million people and called it social improvement. so hang in.

Don't try to build a new country. Make the old one work. It has for over 400 years and by the world standards that's hardly more than yesterday.
