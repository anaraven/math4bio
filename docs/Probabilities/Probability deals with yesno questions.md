# Probability deals with yes/no questions

Let's start from the beginning. We will talk about the basic ideas, and how to combine them.

Probability is ultimately about possible facts. Facts that can be either true or false. We may not know yet if they are true^[If we know positively that the facts are either true or false, then our reasoning will follow the rules of _Logic_, as discussed in other places.]. Or we may have incomplete information about them.

To be more precise, we will deal with _propositions_. These are _logic phrases_ that are either true or false. For example, we can say

+ Today is Monday
+ It is cloudy
+ Air temperature is below 10°C
+ Tomorrow it will snow

All these phrases can be rewritten as questions, and the answer is either "yes" or "no".

+ Is today Monday?
+ Is it cloudy now?
+ Is the air temperature less than 10°C?
+ Will there be snow tomorrow?

(By the way, the answer to all these questions is "no" right now, while I write these words, but some of them may be true when you read them).
In contrast, there are questions that do not have a yes/no question, and cannot be handled with probabilities.

+ Where did I left my umbrella?
+ Who can predict the weather?
+ What can we do to avoid climate change?

These question cannot be answered "yes" or "no", and therefore are not the kind of questions that we will consider.
