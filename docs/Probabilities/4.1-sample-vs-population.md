# Sample versus population
Variance $𝕍X$ and mean $𝔼X$ of the population are often unknown

Usually we only have a small sample $\vec x = (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$

Assuming that all $x_i$ are taken from the same population and are mutually independent, what can we say about the sample mean and variance?

## Expected value of sample variance
$$\text{Var}(\vec x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i (x_i-\bar x)^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i^2-\bar x^2$$
therefore, since $𝔼$ is linear,
$$𝔼\text{Var}(\vec x)=𝔼\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i^2-\frac{1}{n^2}(\sum_i x_i)^2\right)=\frac{1}{n}𝔼\sum_i x_i^2-\frac{1}{n^2}𝔼 (\sum_i x_i)^2$$

Now in the first part we have
$$𝔼\sum_i x_i^2 =\sum_i𝔼 x_i^2=n𝔼 X^2$$

We can simplify the second part as
$$(\sum_i x_i)^2=(\sum_i x_i)(\sum_j x_j)=\sum_i \sum_j x_i x_j$$
therefore
$$𝔼 (\sum_i x_i)^2=\sum_i \sum_j 𝔼 x_i x_j=\sum_i \sum_j 𝔼 (X^2)[i=j] + (𝔼 X)^2 [i\not=j]$$
$$𝔼 (\sum_i x_i)^2= n 𝔼 (X^2) + n(n-1)(𝔼 X)^2$$

Putting it all together
$$𝔼\text{Var}(\vec x)=\frac{1}{n}n𝔼 X^2-\frac{1}{n^2}(n 𝔼 (X^2) + n(n-1)(𝔼 X)^2)$$
$$𝔼\text{Var}(\vec x)=\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)𝔼 X^2-(n-1)(𝔼 X)^2\right)$$
$$𝔼\text{Var}(\vec x)=\frac{n-1}{n}(𝔼 X^2-(𝔼 X)^2)=\frac{n-1}{n}𝕍X$$

## Sample variance is biased
If we want to estimate the mean $𝔼X$ of a population we can use the sample mean $\bar x$

But if we  want to estimate the variance $𝕍X$ of a population we cannot use the sample variance $\text{Var}(x)$

Instead we have to use an estimator
$$\hat{𝕍}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_i(x_i-\bar x)^2$$

## In summary
+ When experiments produce numbers we can calculate average and variance
+ The population has a fixed mean and variance, even if we do not know their values
+ If we have an i.i.d sample we can estimate the population mean with the sample mean
+ The sample mean is probably close to the population mean, independent of the probability distribution
+ If the sample is 4 times bigger, the sample mean is 2 times closer to the population mean
+ The sample variance is not a good estimation of the population variance. We use a different formula in that case.
