Let $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ be a set of $n$ independent random variables, each one following a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. That is
$$y_i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\quad\text{for all }i$$
We will consider linear combinations of several $y_i$. Let
$$x_j = \alpha_{1,j}y_1+\alpha_{2,j}y_2+\cdots+\alpha_{n,j}y_n=\sum_i \alpha_{i,j}y_i$$
