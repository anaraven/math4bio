# Probabilities are a way to describe a unpredictable universe
Things happen in nature and we cannot predict (tell before) what will happen. Or can we?
Given our understanding of any phenomenon, we can make an educated guess of the possible outcomes and their relative importance.

For example, if we have a coin, we know that there are two possible outcomes: heads and tails. If we have a dice then we have 6 possible outcomes. With two dices there are 36 *events*.
