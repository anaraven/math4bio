# Random variables

If we can calculate a number that depends on the outcome of an experiment, that number is called **random variable**.

Formally, a random variable is any function $X:Ω\to ℝ.$
For example, if we throw two dice, we can define $X(ω)$ to be the sum of the spots on the outcome $ω.$

The probability that the spots total seven is the probability of the event $X(ω) = 7.$
To simplify, instead of $\Pr(X(ω) = 7)$ we write $\Pr(X = 7).$
