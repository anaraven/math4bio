# How Google works

+ How google works
  + Page rank evaluates node centrality using the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue
    + Perron Frobenius theorem guarantees that the largest eigenvalue is 1
    + the eigenvector can be found by the power method
    + the matrix can be represented in sparse form
    + same ideas can be applied to other networks
    + To build the graph representing the web, we need to crawl the real web
  + how internet works
    + mathematic ideas behind IP protocols
    + OSI layer model
    + IP, routing
    + DNS
    + ARP
    + how things can fail
    + TCP, HTTP
  + internet security
    + public key methods based on mathematic hard problems
    + certificates
  + How Gmail works
    + Spam detection using Naive Bayes

# How computers work
