# Matrix addition

This one is easy. If we have two matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same dimensions $m\times n$, then we can add them in the natural way:

$$
A+B=
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{11} + B_{11} & A_{12} + B_{12}\\
A_{21} + B_{21} & A_{22} + B_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It is easy to see that the sum of matrices has good properties

- Commutative: $A+B=B+A$
- Associative: $(A+B)+C = A+(B+C)$

# Zero

# Matrix substraction
